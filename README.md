## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
This is my very first project in Javascript.
- Brainstormed ideas to make the web page look appealing to user.
- Identified the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) criteria.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- **Programming Languages**: The project utilises CSS, JavaScript, and HTML to create an interactive web application. These languages allow for dynamic content and provide a solid foundation for building engaging user interfaces.


## :scream: Bugs to fix :hankey:
- **Refresh Button**: this button has no functionality yet in actual. The web page gets refreshed by main page refresh icon.
- **user clicks**: Even after user wins. User can keep on playing. Which needs to be fixed.
By addressing these bugs, the functionality, usability, and overall user experience of the web application would be greatly enhanced.

## :sob: Lessons learnt
During the development of this project, several valuable lessons were learned. If given the opportunity to complete the project again, the following improvements would be considered:

- **Thorough Planning and Idea Exploration**: Taking more time to plan and think through ideas would allow for better anticipation of potential scenarios and edge cases. By considering a wider range of possibilities during the planning phase, it becomes easier to build the project correctly from the beginning, rather than making significant changes after the code is already written.
- **Prioritise Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Development**: Focusing on building the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) before adding additional features is essential. 
- **Iterative Development and Testing**: Adopting an iterative development approach can greatly improve the overall quality of the project. Regular testing and refinement at each iteration ensure that issues are identified and resolved early on, leading to a more stable and reliable application.

By implementing these lessons learned, future projects can benefit from a more efficient and effective development process, resulting in higher-quality software and an improved overall experience for both developers and users.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Background music during the game play experience.
- Background color can be changed once the user wins.
- Score can be displayed.
- Player who is playing the game can be displayed.
- Once user wins celebration needs to be displayed with music.
